 Liz Truss ‘will approve more oil drilling if she becomes PM’,"Tory leadership candidate criticised by campaigners after reports her team have met energy firms

Politics live – latest updates
","['Rob Davies', '@ByRobDavies']","Liz Truss will sign off on a push for more oil drilling in the North Sea if she wins the Conservative leadership election, according to reports, drawing criticism from environmental campaigners.Amid mounting public dismay about soaring energy bills, Truss’s policy advisers are thought to be discussing proposals to issue up to 130 new drilling licences, which typically take nearly three decades to produce any oil and gas.The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, have been meeting oil and gas firms to discuss how to secure energy supplies this winter, the Times reported.Truss’s plans to slash VAT are ‘regressive and flawed’, says Sunak’s teamRead moreThe discussions reportedly involve importing more gas from Norway in the short term, while ramping up domestic production. The climate change committee has previously said it takes an average of 28 years for an exploration licence to lead to oil and gas production.The Greenpeace chief UK scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said intensifying North Sea drilling would do little to bring down energy bills.“Unleashing a North Sea drilling frenzy isn’t a plan to help bill payers but a gift to the fossil fuel giants already making billions from this crisis,” he said.“New oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel the climate crisis.”He said the UK’s dependence on gas was among the factors driving up bills and called for faster action to promote new wind and solar projects, as well as improving energy efficiency by insulating UK homes, which are among the leakiest in Europe.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDeskHe added: “If Liz Truss really wants to help cash-strapped households, she should bring in an energy bill freeze alongside extra financial support for the poorest households, partly funded by properly taxing the astronomical profits of oil and gas companies.”Truss’s North Sea plan comes against the backdrop of a continent-wide scramble to secure gas supplies before the winter, after Vladimir Putin began choking off pipeline flows amid a geopolitical standoff over his invasion of Ukraine.The UK relies more heavily on gas than most European countries and has very little storage after the closure of the Rough facility off the Yorkshire coast in 2017. Labour has previously called on Truss to explain her part in the government’s acquiescence to the closure of Rough.",2022-08-30
Renewed Highland golf course plan has environmentalists crying 'Fore!',Scottish government rejected a new links at Coul to protect the complex dune system but investors have revived the scheme,"['Ewan Murray', '@mrewanmurray']","It is an area so tranquil that the notion of bitter dispute is hugely anomalous. The serenity of Coul - in east Sutherland, north of Dornoch – is in fact fundamental to a backdrop of unrest.When the Scottish government rejected a plan for a golf course at Coul early last year, it appeared those with grand plans had nowhere else to turn. This marked a victory for environmentalists who argued one of the most complex dune systems in Scotland and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) should not be compromised. “The harmful impacts to protected habitats and species would outweigh the potential socio-economic benefits,” said Kevin Stewart, then planning minister. Anne McCall, the director of RSPB Scotland, said: “These damaging proposals threatened a site of global importance for nature and should never have made it this far.”The rich v the very, very rich: the rebellion at Wentworth golf clubRead moreWith American investors key to the project, comparisons were not unreasonably – if unhelpfully to those pursuing a golf course – drawn with Donald Trump’s controversial development in Aberdeenshire. One glance across social media illustrates the depth of feeling attached to Coul and acrimony as attached. One golfer’s paradise is someone else’s idea of vandalism on sacred land.Unbowed, a group of individuals want to bring Coul Links back before the planners. Edward Abel Smith, a London-based landowner, is working in conjunction with the newly formed Communities for Coul. He now wants to build an eco-friendly hotel and will, should planning be granted, hand over his territory for 18 holes at a long-term peppercorn rent. The multimillion dollar question, though, is why this scheme will succeed now when the previous one in early 2020 so publicly failed?“I wouldn’t say we are confident but we feel strongly about the overall benefits that the development would bring,” says Communities for Coul’s Gordon Sutherland. “We want this golf course as a catalyst for economic development. The number of jobs forecast are calculated by businesses prepared to invest; there is almost £50m of private investment lined up and 180 jobs, 108 of which would be full-time.“It would be such an important thing for this area, which had a decreasing population and ageing demographic even before Covid. It’s even more important now to create jobs in this area. We are prepared to fail but we will do everything we can to succeed.”Several developers are interested in this scheme but, once again, it hinges on planning consent. It will be several months before a new application is submitted. Abel Smith admits he is currently presiding over a “loss-making farm”. The issue is, protected links land adjacent to the farm is fundamental for a renowned golf course. “The land has been in my family for a long time,” he says. “I genuinely believe the course is the best option for the area, whilst admitting my vested interest by way of the hotel. I will go as far as the community take this. I don’t see there being other options to benefit the land, the area or the environment in any comparable way.”Highland councillors have previously offered heavy backing. The appetite within Sutherland for the golf course appears strong. “Of the 90,000 or so who signed the online petition against the [rejected] development, less than 0.15% live within the IV25 postcode,” say Communities for Coul. Sutherland adds: “We feel the vast majority of people who live locally support this.” Politically, the prominence or otherwise of the Scottish Greens after upcoming elections could be significant.That Tom Dargie, an ecologist and the chair of Not Coul sits in the opposite camp to Sutherland and Abel Smith feels like gross understatement. Dargie had previously estimated the loss of 48 hectares of dune habitat, should the course go ahead.“As before, sound economics with decent science and respect for protected land are awol from the Coul golf revival plan,” Dargie insists. “Not Coul individuals, possibly with new objectives under a new name, want to campaign for community-led management of all protected wildlife and habitats at Coul Links. We want to enable a vibrant, dynamic, golf-free and self-functioning dune ecosystem, with community initiatives involving many nearby, outside designated land. In short we seek respectful change and living-wage jobs approved by the majority in our community whilst doing no damage to our local supposedly protected environment.”Dargie believes precious little has changed between the rejection of the previous plan and the arrival of Communities for Coul. He adds: “Much is being made in the press of damage to the local economy from Covid-19 lockdown and Brexit but those claims lack substance and are without proven information on local severe effects which are worse than elsewhere in Scotland. Instead, based on the local business results from the restricted 2020 staycation summer, other unquoted local business people feel our economy here will likely boom in staycation 2021 because it is already geared to family tourism, couples and golf on really excellent courses.” True though that may be, it of course ignores the longer term.Where Dargie and Abel Smith do agree is on the poor and overgrown condition of a protected site due to no management plan being in place with NatureScot, previously Scottish Natural Heritage. “I have a productive relationship with NatureScot,” adds Abel Smith. “But they are incredibly stretched.“I haven’t deliberately neglected the land. I would love to see it protected and looked after properly. In my view a golf course is the best way to do that; it takes up a small area and would provide capital to maintain the rest of the SSSI.”Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.In nearby Royal Dornoch, Sutherland houses one of the finest golf venues in the world. Its vice-captain, the professor of economics David Bell, has sent a letter to the local MP, Jamie Stone, regarding golf and the post-pandemic scene. “The golf courses around the Dornoch Firth can play a vital role in recovery from what has been the most devastating economic collapse to affect this area, possibly since the Clearances [eviction of Highland tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries],” says Bell. “The golf industry provides vital employment, allowing younger people to stay in the area. This is particularly important in Sutherland, which faces serious demographic decline. By 2040, its population is likely to be around half of what it was at the time of the Clearances. Highland Council’s own estimates show Sutherland’s population declining by 10.7% between 2021 and 2041.”Dornoch, just like the neighbouring and excellent courses at Golspie, Tain and Brora would benefit from increased footfall. In short, the economic argument here is compelling. Whether that is sufficient to circumvent lingering and deep environmental concerns remains to be seen.",2021-03-22
" Visiting green spaces deters mental health drug use, researchers find","Positive effects were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, says Finnish study","['Damien Gayle', '@damiengayle']","Visits to parks, community gardens and other urban green spaces may lower city dwellers’ use of drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, high blood pressure, and asthma, research has found.Researchers in Finland found that visiting such areas three to four times a week cuts people’s chances of turning to drugs for mental health problems or high blood pressure by a third, and for asthma by about a quarter.Moreover, the positive effects of visiting green spaces were stronger among those reporting the lowest annual household income, the researchers found.Scientist enlists pupils to see how hedges can make greener schoolsRead moreThe findings correlate with a growing body of evidence that a lack of access to green spaces is linked to a range of health problems. Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa – three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland – to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bought too much red cabbage? Turn it into a festive nut roast – recipe,This fantastic vegan centrepiece makes full use of those outer cabbage leaves that all too often just get thrown away,['Tom Hunt'],"I devised today’s nut roast for Oddbox, a veg box outfit that supports farmers by buying wonky fruit and veg that they might otherwise find hard to shift. It’s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it’s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I’ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it’s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup.

‘This year has been very good’: readers’ UK butterfly sightings,"Readers share their favourite sightings over the summer, after news that numbers have risen since last year

UK butterfly numbers bounce back after last year’s all-time low
",['Guardian readers'],"‘Constant companions to our gardening’A peacock butterfly perched on a yellow ragwort, pictured on 9 August. Photograph: Guardian communityWe try to encourage as many pollinators as possible to visit our allotment. As well as growing lots of fruit and veg we have planted many different flowers. Across the summer we saw some unusual moths, such as the ghost moth, and then from August onwards the butterflies started to appear. We mostly spotted red admiral, peacock and small tortoiseshell butterflies. They particularly liked the cosmos and the corn marigolds. They also liked the ragwort, which later had cinnabar moth caterpillars. On sunny days they were constant companions to our gardening. Although we have seen large white butterflies, too, we don’t seem to have had any problems with caterpillars eating our veg. This may be beginner’s luck. Jess and Ian, Scottish Borders ‘I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies’A brown argus butterfly, pictured on 17 July. Photograph: Allan Ferguson/Guardian communityI allowed the grass on the lawn to the front of my house to grow and I planted some wild flowers into it, field scabious, knapweed, bird’s foot trefoil and meadow cranesbill among others. I was delighted by the numbers of butterflies that came to nectar on the flowers, there were lots of meadow browns, gatekeepers, common blues, large and small whites – but I was especially pleased to see about a dozen brown argus, which took up home here for most of July and August. I have been searching for their eggs or caterpillars on the cranesbills, so far without success, but I shall keep looking as it would be nice to know whether they are breeding here. Allan Ferguson, Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire ‘I was lucky enough to see 11 different species’Marie’s sightings at RSPB Minsmere on 16 July. Photograph: Marie Baynham-Davies/Guardian communityOver the summer I went to RSPB Minsmere, mainly to look for rare bird species, but on one visit on 16 July I was lucky enough to see 11 different species of butterfly. I sadly didn’t see a small tortoiseshell all summer, though, which used to be one of the most common to spot. Most of the butterflies were on or near nettles and brambles, showing the importance of leaving wild parts in gardens.The rarest of those 11 species is probably the white admiral (top right, circled in red). It’s only the second time I’ve seen one, so I was really happy. I believe the silver-washed fritillary is fairly common, if you know where to look, but I’ve never had one in my garden so it was exciting to see it, too. My favourite is the peacock, bottom right. It’s one of the more common butterflies but so beautiful; it looks tropical and exotic.

Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityA comma butterfly, pictured on 8 September 2023. Photograph: Sean O’Sullivan/Guardian communityOur fig tree has had a bumper crop this year. We were away for a week visiting family and found that quite a lot of the ripe fruit had gone beyond the ideal picking stage, and insects such as tiny flies and wood lice had begun to feast on them. Most notable, though, was the profusion of wasps and red admiral butterflies gorging themselves on the very overripe fruits. They were often sharing the same single fruit, and from time to time flying around before settling back on that same one or elsewhere in the tree.We’ve still been able to pick more than enough for ourselves and to give to friends, so it’s been a real treat to share so much with the insects this year. There must have been at least a dozen red admirals at one time, and a few speckled woods trying to chase them away. I also saw one comma. Sean O’Sullivan, Banbury, Oxfordshire ‘It has certainly been a good year’A painted lady on Verbena bonariensis, pictured on 12 September. Photograph: Sally Twiss/Guardian communityIt has certainly been a good year for butterflies in our south-facing garden: we’ve seen red admiral, peacock, gatekeeper and various whites in numbers. Comma, small tortoiseshell, brimstone, speckled wood, orange tip and dark green fritillary (also hummingbird hawk moths) were also present. They were attracted by plenty of nectar-rich flowers and food plants, such as nettles and hedge garlic. Sally Twiss, the Blackdown Hills, south-west England ‘A very rare sighting’The Camberwell beauty, photographed on 18 July.We saw a Camberwell beauty in our garden on 18 July at 11.58am. We took it at a distance so as not to disturb it. We reported the sighting to the Dorset Butterfly Conservation organisation and the photograph was published on their gallery. It is my understanding that a Camberwell beauty is a very rare sighting as there is no evidence that it breeds in this country.

Photograph: Guardian communityThis photo of a marbled white butterfly was taken on Ventnor Down on 8 July 2023. On the same day I also saw a small copper, common blue and a six-spot burnet moth. In my view, this year has been very good for butterflies as they are plentiful in our area. We live adjacent to downland so we are well placed to observe wildlife.

"Country diary: Willow tits are here, but good luck with seeing one","Tittesworth Reservoir, Staffordshire: It’s easy to see why these wonderful but maddeningly elusive birds have inspired great poetry",['Mark Cocker'],"The numerous bird feeders here are permanently stocked and flocked around by garden birds. Long-tailed, blue, coal and great tits pop up every second or so; and sparrows come and go with goldfinches, while reed buntings and nuthatches slip in and out among the gaps. But the briefest, most maddening, if most wonderful of all, are the willow tits.I see them usually not as they arrive, but as they leave. They zip in, but intermittently and invariably when you’ve dropped your guard. Again! All they gift you is a mean, hard, visiting call – the driest avian sound in Britain – an invertebrate Zi zi taah taah, like the small complaint of an angry insect.Despite willow tits retaining wide breeding presence through middle England, most people never see them, partly because this verve-filled fidget is so elusive, but also because it has an identical twin – the marsh tit. Almost all features said to be diagnostic of one or the other I have recorded on the wrong species. They’re so alike that not a single Briton twigged there were two black-capped, caramel-backed tits here, until two German ornithologists put us all straight in 1911.Alas for us, this never-you-see-me bird is going again. Willow tits have declined by 94% since 1970 and half of its old range is now blank. Yet continental willow tits recur throughout Eurasia’s woodlands from Amsterdam to Vladivostok. So does it matter? It matters to the poet Steve Ely, who dedicated the slenderest volume to the willow tit with his wonderful pamphlet Zi-zi Taah Taah Taah. Few British birds, except Ted Hughes’ mythopoeic Crow perhaps, are so honoured with poetry that is so densely allusive yet of such thematic grandeur. It is a sort of Waste Land for the willow tit.Try to see the beast and you’ll know why Ely wrote with such passion and why willow tits so deserve a place in our poetry and our land. But the best spot I know to do it is here, where the strange, disconcerting context makes it seem like meeting a small beloved god – say, Vincent van Gogh – in the queue at McDonald’s.

 Scaly stowaway: lizard makes an appearance at Chelsea flower show,Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find the common brown lizard in a pile of logs,['Helena Horton'],"Visitors to Chelsea flower show come from all over the country, and range from senior royals to interested gardeners looking for some new plants.This year, however, there has been a rather special guest – a common brown lizard. Gardeners at the Yeo Valley Organic display were delighted to find him in a pile of logs.In the past, Chelsea was known as a showcase of perfectly manicured lawns and prize-winning blooms in symmetrical flower beds. But there is now a clear trend towards nature-friendly gardening. This has been somewhat controversial, with veteran gardeners including the Royal Horticultural Society rose expert Charles Quest-Ritson arguing that people do not attend flower shows to see piles of logs and patches of nettles. He believes prizes should not be given for “weeds”.But Quest-Ritson is in the minority, and this year’s show features multitudes of nature and eco-friendly gardens including a Cop26 garden and a woodland planting supported by Prince Charles, which urges visitors to “plant a tree for the Queen”.Late flowering: the Chelsea flower show is finally back – but what will it look like in autumn?Read moreYeo Valley Organic’s garden is built to attract amphibians and reptiles, as well as pollinators and insects. It seems to have achieved that aim, with the lizard making himself at home in the log pile.Sarah Mead, who created the Yeo Valley Organic garden, which is a permanent fixture at the company’s farm in Somerset, said there had been a discussion about whether the lizard had hitchhiked from the farm, where materials from the original garden were transported for the mini Chelsea version, or whether had it crawled in as a rare example of a London lizard.She said: “It’s definitely a common brown lizard – there are lots of them in the West Country so we are sure it came down from Yeo Valley in Somerset among the stone that was transported from the farm, but it’s made itself quite at home here.“As lizards are cold-blooded, they like the stone – it’s Mendip stone they’ve brought up from the dry stone walls on the farm, so a perfect environment for lizards, cool with lots of nooks and crannies. Lizards are just one example of the rich biodiversity at Yeo Valley, where they do everything to encourage wildlife.”Common lizards are found across the country, but their numbers are declining because of habitat loss. They thrive in grassland and moorland, as well as the edges of woodlands.The gardeners have enlisted experts from the Wildlife Trusts to help them keep the lizard comfortable at the busy show and teach them more about it.Features of the Somerset garden recreated at Chelsea include an open perennial meadow with flowering plants and a glade of silver birch. The design also features charred logs used as garden markers and rammed earth walls as boundaries, both highlighting the importance of soil health. The garden is designed to show how to create a beautiful and peaceful space that encourages nature and has soil health in mind. Tom Massey, who with the help of Mead designed the show garden, said: “The soil plays a pivotal role in our fight to reverse climate change but the world of microscopic activity under our feet is often overlooked. Carbon is the building block of all life and as gardeners we need to be reminded of the role we play in locking carbon into the soil, where it can help sustain life for generations to come. We want to create a beautiful garden that inspires visitors to think about using more sustainable gardening practices.” This article was amended on 29 September 2021 to remove a mistaken reference in a quote to lizards liking “cool” stone; as they are cold-blooded, it is the relative warmth of the stone that attracts them.",2019-12-01
" Climate crisis could lead to rise of smaller bees, study finds","Danger looms for larger species such as bumblebees, which have lower heat tolerance, leading to ‘cascading effects’ on ecosystems",['Agence France-Presse'],"The climate crisis could lead to more small-bodied bees but fewer bumblebees, according to research warning of potential “cascading” effects on plant pollination and across whole ecosystems.Scientists in the US trapped and studied more than 20,000 bees over eight years in an area of the Rocky Mountains to find out how different types reacted to changing climatic conditions.In research published on Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the authors said that while environmental conditions varied from year to year, the sub-alpine region from which they took samples was “particularly vulnerable to climate change”, with generally warming spring temperatures and earlier snow melt.Fears for bees as US set to extend use of toxic pesticides that paralyse insectsRead moreThey found that larger-bodied bees and comb-building cavity nesters declined in abundance as temperatures increased, while smaller, soil-nesting bees increased.“Our research suggests that climate-induced changes in temperature, snowpack and summer precipitation may drastically reshape bee communities,” the authors said.Researchers said the findings suggested a reduction of bigger bees, including in the families of bumblebee, leafcutters and mason bees, with higher temperatures.Declines were particularly marked for bumblebees, which the researchers said suggested “this group is more threatened under climate warming than other bees in our system”. That tallies with other studies showing that bumblebees, the dominant pollinators in many ecosystems, have a lower heat tolerance than other bees and move to cooler regions at higher altitudes as temperatures warm.Researchers said their findings suggested both bumblebees’ body size and nest behaviour could also make them more vulnerable in a warming world.More broadly, the authors said climate-driven changes to pollinator communities “could have cascading effects on pollination and ecosystem functioning”. For example, they said losing bigger bees, which tend to fly further for food, may mean a reduction in longer-distance pollination.The study was specifically focused on mountainous areas, but the researchers said other research across the US showed declines in larger bees in response to environmental changes.Insects are the world’s top pollinators: 75% of 115 top global food crops depend on animal pollination, including cocoa, coffee, almonds and cherries, according to the UN.In a landmark 2019 report, scientists concluded that nearly half of all insect species worldwide are in decline and a third could disappear altogether by century’s end. One in six species of bees have gone regionally extinct somewhere in the world.The main drivers of extinction are thought to be habitat loss and pesticide use.",2022-04-21
 UK energy industry urges ministers to stick with net zero plan,"Some rightwingers claim renewables have increased costs, but Energy UK blames over-reliance on gas","['Fiona Harvey', '  Environment correspondent']","Energy companies want the government to implement policies to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, the industry’s leader has said, despite claims from some on the political right that high energy prices should spark a rethink.Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the industry, said: “The government should press on with net zero policies. That’s something they still need to do. We are missing the carbon budgets.”She called on ministers to “tighten energy efficiency”, by insulating more homes, and changing planning and construction rules, while developing a strategy for decarbonising the UK’s fleet of gas-fired power stations.She rejected claims that renewable energy had increased costs, saying the problem was clearly an over-reliance on gas, especially for heating. She told a meeting hosted by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit: “The UK is exposed to gas because we have a huge amount of gas burned in our homes, and so helping people get off gas boilers on to other forms of heating technology is critical over the next decades to reduce our reliance on places like Russia.”She added: “But [it’s also necessary] to make our building stock much more energy-efficient. The reason we have high rates of fuel poverty in the UK isn’t just about the commodity we burn, it’s the volume of it we burn because our energy efficiency rates here are much lower than other countries.”Britain’s leaky homes make the energy crisis worse. Why have governments not fixed them? | Max WakefieldRead moreHouseholds are facing an energy price cap rise this April, likely to amount to £2,000 for the average bill, and possibly a further rise to £2,400 in October. The cost-of-living crisis has embroiled the government in calls from its own backbenches to scale back or abandon measures to promote renewable energy and pay for home insulation for poor households, even though renewable energy is many times cheaper than gas and improving home insulation would cut bills for the most vulnerable.Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, called on his fellow Tories to get behind net zero policies, saying only “a very small number” of MPs were questioning them.“Let’s be clear, in terms of delivering net zero, there is no real option other than what the government has set out. It’s a shame that it needs saying, but everyone should rest assured that the bulk of the Conservative party and the government is four-square behind this, and committed to getting it done,” he said.Q&AWhat is net zero?ShowNet zero is the commitment to reducing emissions by 100% so that the UK is producing no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere. This will have to be achieved by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases created by activities such as industrial processes, power generation, transport and intensive agriculture, while removing emissions at the same time by capturing carbon or planting more trees.It is considered the minimum necessary to stop dangerous climate breakdown increasing the world’s temperature by more than 1.5 degrees celsius. However, there is a debate about how to get there, and how quickly, and how the costs will be spread. The current UK government wants to meet net zero by 2050, which will necessarily involve replacing gas boilers, moving to electric cars, improving insulation and lowering high-carbon consumption such as flights and meat-eating.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said consumers were paying unnecessarily high prices for their electricity, as well as their gas, because of the way the UK energy market works. Electricity prices are set by the gas price, even though gas makes up only about 40% of electricity generation and renewable energy prices are far lower.He said the government could ease this by changing the way the UK energy market is structured, allowing for a “pool” of green energy contracts.Ministers should levy a windfall tax on fossil fuel producers, which have seen bumper profits from the global rise in gas prices and Russia’s constraint on European supplies, added Tessa Khan, founder of campaigning organisation Uplift. Taxes on fossil fuels in the UK were far too low, and tiny compared with those of other countries, at about $2 (£1.47) a barrel in the UK compared with more than $20 a barrel for Norway.Even at such low rates, thanks to favourable rules, some fossil fuels had received payouts from the government in recent years, rather than pay tax, she said. Oil and gas producers faced no extra costs but were reaping “windfall profits” from the gas price. “These profits are being privatised.

If I were a panda, I’d be at it all the time. I think from this we can determine two things: first that you are a pervert, and second that you are unhappy.Hey, I’m not unhappy! Maybe you have more in common with pandas than you thought. Researchers have posited that the notoriously low panda libido might be down to simple contentment.How so? Well, a study published in Conservation Biology has suggested that if pandas find the perfect habitat – in this instance a cool, moderately low-lying area rich with bamboo and far from humans – then they will just happily settle down and not go anywhere.Who can blame them? That sounds perfect. Well, the worry is that by staying in the same area, they aren’t going out to search for food or mates, which reduces their genetic diversity, which will eventually lead to their extinction.So you’re saying that pandas prefer comfortable solitude to sex? Yes.And it’s possible to be so comfortable that you might take down your entire species? Yes.Am … am I a panda? If you are, I have to commend your ability to type so accurately with your great big paws.Do scientists want to make pandas less comfortable? To some extent, yes. The researchers have found that the ideal level of comfort to keep the pandas alive is 80%.Why 80%? Because then they are comfortable enough to thrive, but there’s still enough dissatisfaction to make them leave home, bump into a sexy panda stranger and get it on.Great! Job sorted. Well, that’s only step one. Even if two pandas were to clap eyes on each other and instantly fall in love, it doesn’t mean that we would hear the pitter patter of tiny paws any time soon. Remember the story of Tian Tian?Tian Tian? Yes, one of the UK’s only two giant pandas, leased to Edinburgh zoo a decade ago by the Bifengxia breeding centre in Sichuan, China. The lease runs out in December, and Tian Tian has failed to give birth.Why? Sometimes it just doesn’t happen. She had cubs in China, only to endure a number of failed pregnancies – some initiated by artificial insemination – in Edinburgh. Things went further downhill when her partner, Yang Guang, had his testicles removed, after a tumour was discovered.God, that’s sad. Is it? Or is she just so happy that she has rejected sex as a concept?There’s a moral here, isn’t there? Yes. It’s that it’s OK if personal contentment is more important to you than romantic love. And also that pandas are seemingly determined to make themselves extinct.Do say: “Happy pandas don’t have sex.”Don’t say: “Quick, someone invent Panda Instagram to make them all feel ugly and insecure.”",2021-03-12
 Shell chief vows to bolster emissions strategy after court ruling, Ben van Beurden pledges to ‘rise to challenge’ after court ordered oil firm to cut global carbon emissions by 45%,['Joanna Partridge'],"Royal Dutch Shell has vowed to accelerate its strategy towards becoming a net zero emissions business, two weeks after a Dutch court ruling ordered the company to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels.Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, promised to “rise to the challenge” in helping to create a low-carbon energy system, but came out fighting for the Anglo-Dutch oil company he runs, insisting it has been leading the industry in taking responsibility for its carbon emissions.In a statement on his LinkedIn page, Van Beurden said he was surprised by the court’s verdict and was “disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions”.He added: “A court ordering one energy company to reduce its emissions – and the emissions of its customers – is not the answer.”The transition to low-carbon energy, which remained necessary to battle the climate emergency, was “far too big a challenge for one company to tackle”, he wrote, calling for clearer regulations and policies from global governments.It’s time to nationalize Shell. Private oil companies are no longer fit for purpose | Johanna Bozuwa and Olúfẹ́mi O TáíwòRead moreShell said it was reviewing the ruling handed down last month by a court in The Hague and expected to appeal. But the court has said its decision is immediately applicable and should not be suspended before an appeal.Shell’s oil production had probably peaked in 2019, Van Beurden said, adding that he believed the firm’s total absolute carbon emissions would decline from 2018 levels. Instead, he said Shell should work with its customers to help them find their own way to achieving net zero emissions.The oil firm said it would continue to produce oil and gas products “for a long time to come” in order to meet customer demand and retain the company’s financial strength, while also attracting investment.“Imagine Shell decided to stop selling petrol and diesel today. This would certainly cut Shell’s carbon emissions. But it would not help the world one bit,” Van Beurden wrote. “Demand for fuel would not change. People would fill up their cars and delivery trucks at other service stations.”The company said it had “rigorous, short-term reduction targets” on the way to its goal of becoming a net zero emissions business by 2050. The chief executive added that Shell had taken responsibility for reducing the carbon emissions it produced, as well as those produced when customers used its products.The landmark Dutch case was brought by the environmental group Friends of the Earth and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs, who successfully argued that Shell had been aware of the dangerous consequences of CO2 emissions for decades, and that and its targets remained insufficiently robust.The company was told by the court that its emission reductions, along with those of its suppliers and buyers, should be brought into line with the Paris climate agreement.Although it intended to appeal against the ruling, Shell said it would “seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable”.As part of its energy transition strategy, Shell said it had in recent years invested “billions of dollars” in lower-carbon energy, including wind and solar power, hydrogen and biofuels.Shell has vowed to give investors a chance to vote on the progress of its transition strategy at every annual shareholder meeting. Van Beurden complained that the court hearing took place several months before the publication of the strategy.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Shell faced a significant investor rebellion at its most recent AGM, when a shareholder resolution coordinated by Follow This, a Dutch climate activist group, calling for the company to set binding carbon emissions targets received 30% of votes.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said Van Beurden had “failed to have his epiphany moment, and still thinks that committing to the Paris agreement is an unfair ask. More stakeholders than ever are pushing for Paris-alignment and there comes a time when Shell will have to listen and act. Butvan Beurden can take comfort that Shell is not alone in this challenge.”Rachel Kennerley, an international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said Shell’s promises did not far enough.She added: “If Mr van Beurden was as serious about this as he claims, he’d stop dismissing his company’s role in driving this devastating situation and would use the court ruling as an intervention to do the right thing, rather than appealing it with all of Shell’s corporate might.”",
Country Diary: Down on the floor with the solitary bees,"Holywell, Flintshire: In my attempts to make my garden more suitable for Mediterranean herbs, I created the conditions for these fascinating insects",['Jan Miller'],"I’m lying on my front on the moist, mossy lawn, the sun warming my back. Around me swallows are swooping in and out of the barn while dandelions, lady’s smock and cowslips attract the butterflies and bees. But down here, my attention is focused under the box hedges of my herb garden. I am watching volcanoes form. Not the sort that spew hot lava, but small cones of the gritty soil with a vent in the top about the size of my little fingernail.A tawny mining bee: ‘The 240 species of solitary bees in Britain … are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee.’ Photograph: Jan MillerThese are the entrances to the breeding burrows of the tawny mining bee, Andrena fulva. They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don’t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen. Then they’re sealed up and the larvae left to hibernate over winter, until they dig their way out the next spring.I could never grow Mediterranean herbs such as thyme, sage, oregano, orpine or lavender in my damp garden until a few years ago, when I had this square dug out and filled with limestone hardcore. Unwittingly, I had also made the perfect place for these mining bees to breed. It also helped that this was under the bit of lawn where we once had the kids’ sandpit.Meanwhile, the osmia mining bees – the red mason and the leafcutter bees you can buy nesting houses for in garden shops – are a different species. I was puzzled to see an osmia scrabbling against the mud-sealed doors once, as I thought it couldn’t be a predator of its own kind. A quick post on the Facebook page of the specialist Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society got me an answer in 10 minutes – it was the male who could “smell” the virgin female inside and was desperate to mate with her before any other.

"Monday briefing: The dramatic, agonising, crucial talks that will decide Cop27’s success","In today’s newsletter: For the next two weeks, ministers, negotiators from countries large and small will gather in Egypt. Can they get anything done?",['Archie Bland'],"Good morning. Last year, the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow kept alive the target of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; but, conference president Alok Sharma said, “its pulse is weak”. The vital question for the Cop27 summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt, which began yesterday, is whether it will prove to be an emergency room or a hospice.If Cop27 is to have any chance of renewing global commitments after a year of extremely limited progress, the work of the negotiators who will take over once world leaders have departed at the end of today will be crucial. I spoke to the Guardian’s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about the fascinating, byzantine, surprisingly dramatic and extremely nerdy process of climate diplomacy – and why, as deeply frustrating as it might be, it matters so much.That’s after the headlines. And a quick note to say that I’m off the rest of this week – Nimo and recurring guest star Dan Milmo will be in your inbox.Five big stories
Economy | Jeremy Hunt will announce £25bn worth of tax rises and £35bn in spending cuts at the autumn statement, the Guardian understands. The scale of the measures has grown significantly after the Bank of England’s dire forecasts last week of the longest recession since the 1930s.
Ukraine | The Biden administration has reportedly warned Kyiv that allies’ “Ukraine fatigue” could worsen if Volodymyr Zelenskiy continues to be closed to negotiations with Russia.
Climate crisis | An assessment by Carbon Brief has found the US, UK and Canada have fallen billions of dollars short of their “fair share” of climate funding for low-income countries. This comes after the UN’s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years were the eight hottest ever recorded, putting the internationally agreed 1.5C limit for global heating “barely within reach”.
Politics | Rishi Sunak is facing further questions over his political judgment after it emerged he was made aware of a complaint against his political ally Gavin Williamson before appointing him. Sunak was said to have been unaware of the contents of hostlile texts sent to former chief whip Wendy Morton.
Housing | More than 138,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies. In London the offshore holdings are worth as much as £55bn.
In depth: ‘It’s awful and frustrating – but you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop’A worker prepares the entrance to the “Green Zone” ahead of Cop27. Photograph: Thomas Hartwell/APThere are “periods of intense activity and huge longueurs” at climate summits, says Fiona Harvey in Sharm-el-Sheikh; happily, I reach her during one of the longueurs.She emphasises that this is not a “decision summit” like Glasgow. Instead, the focus will be on holding countries accountable for their commitments last year against the backdrop of the global energy crisis brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In this piece from May, UN climate adviser Rachel Kyte describes the task as “implementation, implementation, implementation”.“We won’t get an agreement or a new treaty at the end of it,” Fiona said. “But it’s incredibly important we see progress.” This piece explains why it’s looking so tough, while this one sets out the vital importance of “loss and damage” financing for developing nations – which was finally confirmed as part of the agenda for the talks after “fractious” discussions that dragged late into the night and delayed the opening of the conference proper.In the Guardian’s Down to Earth newsletter (sign up here for twice-weekly updates throughout Cop27), Fiona writes: “This year’s Cop will be arguably the hardest yet.” The only path to success is through the endless minutiae of negotiation – “a lot of horrible absurdity”, Fiona said. “People arguing in rooms for hours.” Here’s how it works.What is the framework for the summit?“The first two days are about world leaders being there and having their photos taken and talking,” Fiona said. “After that, the negotiators get on with it. In the second week, next Tuesday, we get the ‘high-level segment’ – that’s when ministers join the talks.”All Cop summits take place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed almost 30 years ago. Everything that happens in Sharm-el-Sheikh – “the fact of the meeting, setting the agenda, the texts agreed at the end of it” – is a product of the UNFCCC.“It was a massive achievement,” Fiona said. “It is full of frustrations, but you can’t redraw it now – you just wouldn’t get people to sign up to it. The important thing is that it means that once things are agreed, countries have a legal obligation to see them through.”Who are the negotiators?Countries are represented individually, but blocs of nations with common interests – like the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, and the Small Island Developing States – seek to increase their negotiating power by clubbing together.“The big countries have teams of negotiators who do nothing all year round but these talks,” Fiona said. “They will have someone in every workstream, in every room. The poorer ones can’t do that – they will send one country to one event, another to another, and compare notes.”For a sense of what it’s like negotiating on behalf of those most vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis, see this riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the work of Giza Gaspar-Martins, chair of the Least Developed Countries group at the Paris summit in 2015. He dashes from meeting to meeting across the impractically vast site, pausing only to “talk to my wife” (smoke a cigarette) and “do the things I cannot delegate” (go to the loo).What do they negotiate over?“It’s hilarious on one level, awful on another,” Fiona said. “It just sounds incomprehensible to anyone outside of this bizarre bubble. There are non-papers, ‘informal informals’, acres of square brackets, rows about the placements of semicolons. They sit for hours hammering it all out.”But these arcane points really matter. As Giza Gaspar-Martins says of a draft of the final Paris agreement: “We need to do some detective work. Some good brains have been working hard to hide things in here.”Also in Paris, a last-minute row over whether a “shall” ought to have been a “should” was only resolved with the dubious claim that a “typographical error” had been made, allowing the US to overlook a stronger commitment than it wanted on mitigation efforts in the final text. (Here’s a terrific account of that drama by the Guardian’s then-environment editor John Vidal.)In Glasgow, Alok Sharma fought back tears as he apologised to delegates over a late change, forced by China and India, changed a commitment to “phase out” coal to the looser promise to “phase down” its use. “Did I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way?” John Kerry said afterwards. “No. But if we hadn’t done that, we wouldn’t have a deal.”How do these agreements get reached?The country holding the presidency – Egypt this year – will assign countries responsibility for managing negotiations over particular areas. “There’s an ‘ad hoc working group’ for every key part of the process that will meet in their own little rooms,” Fiona said. “So the Cop president will say on climate finance, for example, let’s have one developed and one developing country go away and convene other countries for talks.”Also helpful, Fiona added, is the way the summit allows for accidental interactions of key players. “This is the only forum which puts the developing countries on a somewhat level playing field,” she said. “They can catch a minister from an EU nation in a corridor, and say, with moral authority, ‘come on, mate’. That’s important.”None of this is very glamorous. Pictures abound from previous Cops of windowless shoeboxes with uncomfortable looking chairs shoehorned around a table covered in cold pizza and heavily annotated drafts. But it’s necessary work ahead of the final stage of discussions in the plenary session, which all countries attend.How does the text get finally agreed?One criticism of the consensus model of the Cop summits – which sees the text agreed in a final session involving every country – is that it enforces the “will of the laggards”: the argument is that is easy for countries that are reluctant to adopt crucial climate change measures to put a spanner in the works.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saudi Arabia and Russia are happy to be the people in closed rooms making criticisms, but they don’t want to put themselves out there like that. So the process of consensus can force the laggards to catch up, and it outs those who won’t agree.”She points to the example of Durban 2011, where the treaty that became the Paris agreement was born. “Everyone was on board except China and India, and the EU forced a showdown – the talks went on for days, and in the end the EU called out China and India, and said, are you going to stand up? And they didn’t.”Does all of this add up to a process that meets the vast crisis already under way? Hardly. “You sit there and you talk about five-year review processes – we haven’t got five bloody years,” Fiona said. “But while Cop won’t solve the climate crisis, you can’t solve the climate crisis without Cop. It’s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it’s still essential. These discussions are incredibly important because they’re the only discussions we’ve got.”What else we’ve been reading

  Egg prices could rise for UK consumers as farmers cut flock numbers,Fewer laying birds are being placed on farms as producers respond to poor retail profit margins,"['Supported by', 'About this content', 'Tom Levitt']","Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins.The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government  figures.Egg farmers have been warning for months that a “tidal wave” of rising costs in feed, energy, labour and packaging was not being reflected in retail prices.They have criticised supermarkets for ignoring industry warnings, with a leading producer telling delegates at the British Pig and Poultry Fair last week he expected a shortage of eggs later this year given the cuts in chick placings.The government data, published on Thursday, confirms a decline in producers restocking their flocks with new birds. The number of eggs being set by hatcheries fell even further in April, down 35% on the previous year.The number of chicks being placed by egg producers indicates the number of eggs that will be available to consumers in the months ahead.Hen eggs take about 21 days to hatch, but chicks do not start laying until they are aged about 20 weeks. Any reduction in chicks now will not affect the availability of eggs until the autumn.The existing hens on farms will continue producing eggs until they are 70 to 80 weeks old, but the overall flock population will fall as hens are not replaced.Free-range eggs unavailable in Britain from MondayRead more“It’s showing what we were predicting, that there will be a shortage unless retailers respond by raising prices,” said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British FreeRange Egg Producers Association.Gooch says producers need a 3p per egg price increase to forestall a much bigger price rise when supplies fall later this year. Retail egg prices in May were up by about 8%, or 15p, per half dozen from last year, according to Trolley.co.uk, a supermarket price tracker.“If you were making money you wouldn’t do it [not restock]. You only do it because you can’t make a profit. It’s a crisis for producers and it will translate into a crisis for consumers later this year,” said Gooch.Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said supermarkets sourced most of their food from the UK and “know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers to ensure British eggs remain on the shelves”.A spokesperson for the British Egg Industry Council said chick placements did historically rise and fall depending on factors such as how long producers decide to keep their existing hens before replacing them. “However, with the current cost crisis, some producers are choosing not to repopulate their houses.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We recognise the challenges faced by the egg industry, including the ongoing impact of Avian Influenza and increased input costs – and are continuing to monitor the situation, working closely with stakeholders.” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

" Here in British Columbia, we have spent the summer running from cruel wildfires Mary Stockdale",Blazes are destroying whole communities. The Canadian government must act now to tackle this existential threat,,"Small fires crackle into life on the hills around us at the slightest provocation. Creeks swell with flash floods, as upland snow melts at record speed. Our town’s beloved colony of great blue herons fall stunned out of the trees in their dozens. Animals, from cougars to rattlesnakes, leave their hidden places to seek water. The temperature has risen, and stalled, at a nearly unbearable 45C.This is what a heat dome feels like in Vernon, a community in the British Columbian interior in Canada.It’s been quite the summer in British Columbia (BC), where a brutal heatwave has given way to wildfires. At 49.6C, the village of Lytton set a hotter record than there’s ever been in Las Vegas. The fires have burned nearly 8,582 sq km of forest since the spring and caused evacuation orders to be issued across the province. Lytton and another nearby community, Monte Lake, have been destroyed by the vengeful climate.Our fire, here in Vernon, announced itself with a wave of thick smoke and a glowing red horizon that made us think of JRR Tolkien’s Mordor. At midnight, an evacuation order was issued for the west side of the Okanagan Lake, where members of the Okanagan Indian Band live among enclaves of retirees, ranchers and back-to-the-landers. Soon after, two exhausted evacuees arrived at our door with their dogs, cats and belongings; they are friends of ours, to whom we had promised refuge.As the fire grew across the lake over the next few days, we found ourselves talking with hushed voices. Unable to ignore the red glare on the horizon, we felt awestruck by the ash floating from the sky, covering our decks, outdoor tables and car windshields. We shared photos of the piles of burnt forest debris, mainly small black twigs and needles, that had washed ashore on the lake’s beaches. We spoke obsessively of the air quality index, which I estimated had reached 45 times the World Health Organization exposure recommendation, ranking it as one of the worst on the planet.Mary Stockdale’s son, pictured far right, with other firefighters near Vernon, British Columbia. Photograph: Justin RobertsonSometimes it was not ash, but still-glowing embers that floated over to our side of the lake. Although the water provided a natural barrier to the front of the fire, it was being breached by these small missiles, and all of us had to look lively for any fires that started up under these tinder-dry conditions.As the situation worsened, an evacuation alert for Vernon was announced, stirring us all into action. My husband and I started packing. What do we need to live on? What don’t we want to lose to the fire? My mother was trying to do the same next door, but she was hampered by my bewildered father who has dementia. My daughter ran over to help.Eventually, we assembled a convoy of vehicles, packed to the brim and ready to move our three-generation family, our twice-evacuated friends and our assortment of pets. We worried about what it would be like if the people of greater Vernon got the order to evacuate, and all 66,000 of us tried to move out at once.Later that day, the cultural centre across the street decided to go ahead with its live outdoor concert. Like passengers on the Titanic, we sat on our ashy front steps and listened to the music. To our delight, the first rainstorm in weeks blew in to rescue us, and we jumped up to dance in the raindrops, accompanied by the happy whoops of the musicians over the loudspeakers.As a result of the rain, the evacuation alert was rescinded, at least for most of Vernon. However, the west side remained evacuated, with dozens of homes burned to the ground. I joined many other community members in volunteering to help with the registration of several thousand evacuees and their referral to emergency services.It’s good that the BC government looks after people’s basic needs: shelter, food, clothing, incidentals, but this doesn’t alleviate their misery. These were emotionally exhausted people: an elderly woman who longed for her home and garden; a man who had put his back out with the effort of moving house; a family who, in rescuing their grandmother with her oxygen tank, were forced to jettison most of their belongings. Saddest of all was a young family who broke down telling us about the mother dog with puppies that they had to abandon to the flames when fleeing the fire.In the cadet barracks on the south side of town, 250 soldiers were brought in to help us, and a camp was set up on the north side for 330 firefighters. A small group of locals have gathered at a spot on the highway to cheer them home each evening.How can Britain be committed to net zero when it’s about to drill for millions more barrels of oil? | Greg MuttittRead moreMy son, a 21-year-old firefighter, called. Since he was new to this, we had hoped they would put him to work digging ditches, but he was sent straight to the front, where he said it was like a war zone: helicopters buzzing, smoke thick, trees suddenly candling.My brother called. A fire researcher, he’s been making predictive models from satellite imagery for the firefighters. He was feeling anxious for us, as he could see that a second heatwave was on its way, to be followed by gusting winds that might stir up our fire again.Once again, we have been thrust into a period of uncertainty. What will happen to us and to other endangered communities to the north and east of our fire?A federal election has just been called in Canada. We desperately hope our region’s voters, given all that we have gone through, will send a strong protest vote to Ottawa, saying they must take the climate crisis seriously.

 This article is more than 5 months oldSunak’s plan for carbon capture is good news: he shouldn’t muddy it with party politicsThis article is more than 5 months oldSimon Jenkins,Consensus on tackling the climate crisis is what’s needed now – and direct action against CO2 must be the next move,,"For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak’s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford’s Myles Allen and Edinburgh’s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway’s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark’s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak’s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling ‘entirely consistent’ with net zero plan – UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak’s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly “unachievable” and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone – producers and consumers – would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.

" This article is more than 11 months oldFood, feed and fuel: global seaweed industry could reduce land needed for farming by 110m hectares, study findsThis article is more than 11 months old",Scientists identify parts of ocean suitable for seaweed cultivation and suggest it could constitute 10% of human diet to reduce impact of agriculture,"['Graham Readfearn', '@readfearn']","An area of ocean almost the size of Australia could support commercial seaweed farming around the world, providing food for humans, feed supplements for cattle, and alternative fuels, according to new research.Seaweed farming is a nascent industry globally but the research says if it could grow to constitute 10% of human diets by 2050 it could reduce the amount of land needed for food by 110m hectares (272m acres) – an area twice the size of France.But the authors of the research said there are a range of potential negative impacts on marine life that will need to be balanced with the benefits of a global seaweed farming industry.The study looked at 34 seaweed species and where they could feasibly grow and then narrowed this down to places with calm enough waters and close enough to populations where farms could be established.Have we reached ‘peak meat’? Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestockRead moreAbout 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.“Cultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,” the authors wrote.Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: “People around the world are looking at the ocean as this big ‘untapped’ resource and asking if we should be using more of it.”One of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 – about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits. In parts of Asia, seaweed makes up 2% of diets, but scaling this up to 10% globally could spare 110m hectares of land currently used for growing food.“Basically this is just people eating more vegetables,” he said. “If we grow seaweed, the best thing to do is for people to eat it rather than feed it to livestock, but that’s going to need some big cultural shifts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is done on a large scale we need to find better materials.”He said if there was a widescale push globally for seaweed farming, there could be social implications.“Marine industries do not have a great reputation on human rights and if we’re farming seaweed largely out of sight, then we need to think of the people in these industries and make sure they’re being fairly treated,” he said.",2023-01-27
" This article is more than 4 months oldUS behind more than a third of global oil and gas expansion plans, report findsThis article is more than 4 months old",Study highlights conflict between Washington’s claims of climate leadership and its fossil fuel growth plans,"['Fiona Harvey', ' Environment editor']","The US accounts for more than a third of the expansion of global oil and gas production planned by mid-century, despite its claims of climate leadership, research has found.Canada and Russia have the next biggest expansion plans, calculated based on how much carbon dioxide is likely to be produced from new developments, followed by Iran, China and Brazil. The United Arab Emirates, which is to host the annual UN climate summit this year, Cop28 in Dubai in November, is seventh on the list.The data, in a report from the campaign group Oil Change International, also showed that five “global north countries” – the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK – will be responsible for just over half of all the planned expansion from new oil and gas fields to 2050.Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the oil and gas expansion that is planned in the next three decades would be more than enough to drive global temperatures well beyond the limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels that countries agreed in 2021 at Cop26 in Glasgow, the report found.The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration and development could take place if the world was to stay within the 1.5C limit. But only a handful of countries with oil and gas reserves are forswearing new exploration and drilling.Romain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International and co-author of the report, said countries must call a halt to fossil fuel expansion. “It’s simple: when you are in a hole, the first step is to stop digging,” he said. “The climate crisis is global in nature, but is atrociously unjust. A handful of the world’s richest nations are risking our future by willingly ignoring the calls to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.”The report, titled Planet wreckers: how 20 countries’ oil and gas extraction plans risk locking in climate chaos, published on Tuesday, found that 20 countries were responsible for plans for new oil and gas developments by 2050 that would add about 173bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That amount is the same as the lifetime emissions of 1,100 coal-fired power plants, or more than 30 years of the US’s annual emissions.By contrast, if countries were to forego bringing new oil and gas fields into production, the decline of existing fields would mean global oil and gas production would slow by about 2% a year from now to 2030, and 5% a year from 2030 to 2050.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has stepped up calls for countries to get out of fossil fuels, warning of “moral and economic madness”, and has said fossil fuel interests have “humanity by the throat”. He will convene a conference of world leaders later this month in New York to try to elicit fresh commitments to tackle the climate crisis.He has told world leaders they will be allowed to participate in the summit, on the sidelines of the annual UN general assembly, only if they can show that they have clear implementation plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.The Guardian revealed at the weekend that Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, had been warned of the UN’s strict policy on whether leaders could participate before he took the highly unusual decision not to attend the UN general assembly.Sunak promised over the summer to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas operations in the North Sea, with scores of potential new licences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We know we cannot keep opening up new oil and gas fields if we want a habitable world, yet that is exactly what this government is doing.”She added: “Rishi Sunak needs to stop bowing to the demands of the fossil fuel companies, who continue to rake in obscene profits while millions of us cannot afford to heat our homes.”A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “This report ignores the great strides we have taken in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Between 1990 and 2021, we cut emissions by 48% while growing our economy by 65% – decarbonising faster than any other G7 country.“Even in 2050, when we have reached net zero, it is estimated the UK may still be using a quarter of the gas we do now and, as well as strengthening our energy security, independent research has shown domestically produced gas is on average four times cleaner than imports.”",2023-09-12
"The Guardian view on switching off: in an always-on culture, we need time to thinkEditorial",Midwinter is for hibernation and the chance to make different kinds of connections,,"“Disconnect from the internet for at least two hours a day and treat your own thoughts like a garden through which you are strolling,” was the advice offered by the novelist Ian McEwan to younger writers after being made a Companion of Honour in December. The capacity to be curious about mental processes – while simultaneously experiencing them – is an important one for an author seeking to describe the human condition. But anyone who values self-awareness will be used to noticing how their mind works and wondering why.“Only connect” was the maxim of another famous novelist, EM Forster. Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time. But McEwan’s recommendation to disconnect should not be understood as a repudiation of Forster’s humanism. He was not warning writers off paying attention to other people’s minds and ideas – but drawing attention to the need to spend time with our own. In a world of permanent connection, in which attention has been commodified, switching off and away from the outside world is arguably harder than ever before.Many of us are so attached to our phones and other devices that even a temporary separation provokes anxiety (though less so for those whose jobs are not screen-based, and whose communications are arguably better balanced as a result). The Guardian’s new series Reclaim Your Brain is a response to the growing frustration that many feel at the hold that smartphones have on our minds and happiness, and explores ways of resetting that relationship.But tuning out, whether for two hours or two weeks, is not only about defying the masters of the digital universe – or turning back the clock to a time before news was 24/7 and phones were video cameras. What is turned towards also counts. The long evenings of January, with a new year stretching ahead of us, can be a good time for introspection as well as the self-improvement that traditionally takes the form of resolutions such as diets and exercise plans.John Keats set out his theory of “negative capability” in a letter written in the middle of winter, after an evening walk with a friend. We cannot say whether the shortness of the day inspired the direction that the poet’s thoughts took that evening in 1817. But the state of not knowing that Keats believed artists should aspire to – the ability to be “in uncertainties, Mysteries and doubts without any irritable reaching after fact or reason” – seems more fitted to gloomy candlelight than blazing sunshine.Doing nothing can be boring. Being alone can be miserable. Far too many people in the UK this winter are experiencing severe material or social deprivation. To those whose lives are otherwise full – of activities, appointments, responsibilities, pleasures – a few weeks’ hibernation may be welcome. For many others, it is a more stimulating life, rather than a quieter, more secluded one, that is desired.But for others, this time of year is valuable for the sense of slowing down it brings; the chance to take stock either on one’s own or through talking with others. Looking ahead is one aspect of this. Another is looking back and inward; or not looking at all, but being in the moment with our hopes, mysteries and doubts.",2024-01-06
 Britain arrives at Cop27 in disarray over the climate – and the world’s leaders know itLucy Sherriff,"After Johnson’s weak energy plan and Truss’s scepticism, we have Rishi Sunak, who didn’t even want to attend",,"“Unless we take urgent action, we will get 3C hotter,” Boris Johnson told the UN climate talks in 2020. “As a country … we must now act.” The former prime minister’s words were a rallying cry to galvanise the government into taking action on global heating.Johnson’s administration had been under heavy fire for its lacklustre approach to the climate crisis. But fast forward a year to Cop26, and not much had changed. Johnson’s appearance was criticised as much as his policies; he was described as “a clown” after comparing the climate emergency to James Bond wrestling with a ticking bomb. His comments were in keeping with the travelling circus act that he has been performing ever since he first entered politics – even the future of the world was a joke.The government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 and its plan to phase out petrol-powered vehicles by 2035 were certainly a steer in the right direction. But Johnson’s pledges – and his words – proved meaningless.Long before he was ousted as Conservative leader, his energy security strategy fell flat; originally promised for March this year, it was delayed by weeks. The final product failed to deliver on the government’s original promises to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, Johnson promised investment in offshore windfarms and new nuclear plants, the benefits of which won’t be felt for years.In September, the UK missed its deadline to pay nearly $300m to the developing countries hit hardest by the climate crisis, from Honduras to Afghanistan to Ethiopia. The money was pledged at Cop26, where poorer nations, gripped by floods, droughts and rising sea levels, had called for $100bn of financial aid. The global south has been plagued by climate-induced disasters, the likes of which the western world has yet to experience. India, for example, has witnessed a climate-induced disaster almost every day so far this year.00:04:00Cop27: the climate carnage we've faced this year – videoBut it is these beleaguered countries that have been urged to halt their industrial development and switch to greener means in order to curb climate change, despite western powers’ prolific use of fossil fuels. After years of lecturing India, China, Indonesia and other members of the developing world about coal dependence, the UK – and Europe – is now turning to coal-powered generation to see it through the impending energy crisis caused by the Ukraine-Russia war. A blistering, shameful irony that only betrays how ill-prepared we really are for a clean energy future. And to add insult to injury, the government recently offered new licences to drill in the North Sea.The UK’s dire lack of action on the impending climate catastrophe has been compounded by a revolving door of prime ministers. Many breathed a sigh of relief when Liz Truss – who expressed scepticism about the ambitious action needed to meet net zero goals, wanted to suspend green levies and moved to overturn a ban on fracking, among various other climate faux pas – handed in her notice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But Rishi Sunak’s initial decision not to attend this year’s talks because he was too focused on the domestic economy exposed exactly where the new government’s priorities lie. An insular approach to climate change is absolutely the wrong one. Turning inwards and focusing on self-interests is what got us here in the first place.Sadly, Sunak’s U-turn comes too late. We have already glimpsed behind the veil, along with the rest of the world. “It seems as if they are washing their hands of leadership,” remarked Belize’s ambassador to the UN, Carlos Fuller.The world will not forget the prime minister so publicly prioritising his home turf over the world’s most pressing issues. What the UK needs – what the world needs – is to turn ambition into action, and to pursue a global approach to tackling the crisis.It is now abundantly clear that we are not going to meet the 1.5C target for global heating agreed by western leaders with such conviction at the historic Paris climate talks in 2015. And, as David Attenborough said during his Cop26 speech, we have now reached a stage of “desperate hope”. Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist",2022-11-06
